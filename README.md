# OnionHosting - Theme

I was looking for a cool theme to build an admin panel for my  CMS, and things quickly got out of hand. After giving a trained AI some great markup to work with, a fantastic new theme was born. Now I have an extra one! Haha.

This is a fun, old-school hacker-style HTML/CSS theme for a web hosting with user panel. It was created with the help of a trained AI, focusing on a minimal, secure, and terminal-like aesthetic.

## ğŸš€ Features
* **Hacker Aesthetic:** Dark theme, green glow effects, and a custom hacker-style font.
* **Simple & Clean:** A straightforward layout for managing basic hosting tasks like file management and database access.
* **Purely Frontend:** This is a static HTML/CSS template. It doesn't include any backend functionality.

## âœ¨ Usage
Feel free to use and modify this theme for your projects. It's a great starting point if you're building and want a unique, functional design.

## ğŸ“„ License
This theme is open source and available under the MIT License. Use it as you wish!

Made with love and a bit of code magic. âœ¨
